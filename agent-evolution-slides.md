# AI Agent Evolution in Home Lending
## From Simple Q&A to Autonomous Loan Processing

---

## The Evolution Journey

### Stage 1: Knowledge Assistant (RAG)
**Capability**: Answer credit policy questions
- Simple Q&A about lending criteria
- Policy interpretation
- Static information retrieval

**Example**: "What's the maximum LVR for investment properties?"

---

### Stage 2: Intelligent Calculator (Tool Use)
**Capability**: Dynamic serviceability calculations
- Integrates with internal APIs
- Uses ready reckoners for complex income
- Interactive data collection

**Example**: "Can I afford a $800k loan with my business income?"
- Agent asks follow-up questions
- Calculates using trust/self-employed income tools
- Provides personalized serviceability assessment

---

### Stage 3: Application Copilot (Contextual Intelligence)
**Capability**: Smart application assistance
- Analyzes full application context
- Answers complex queries about specific deals
- Provides recommendations based on policy
- Identifies issues and suggests solutions

**Example**: "Why is this deal declining?" → Agent analyzes DTI, identifies trust income not included, suggests restructure options

---

### Stage 4: Autonomous Processor (Workflow Automation)
**Capability**: End-to-end autonomous execution
- Orchestrates entire application workflow
- Executes tasks with human-in-loop approval
- Takes applications to unconditional approval
- Full audit trail and compliance

**Example**: Autonomously orders valuation → requests approval → gets approval → proceeds → packages for final credit sign-off
