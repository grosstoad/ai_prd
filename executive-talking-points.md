# Executive Talking Points: AI Agent Evolution

## One-Liner Summary
"We're evolving from answering questions to autonomously processing loans with human oversight - each stage delivers immediate value while building toward intelligent automation."

## The Four Stages Explained Simply

### Stage 1: "The Expert Assistant"
**What it does**: Answers any credit policy question instantly
**Real example**: "Can we lend to a temporary resident with 6 months left on their visa?"
**Business impact**: Reduces policy queries by 70%, ensures consistent decisions

### Stage 2: "The Smart Calculator"
**What it does**: Figures out if someone can afford a loan by asking the right questions
**Real example**: Customer says "I'm self-employed" → Agent asks about business structure → Pulls right calculators → Provides accurate borrowing capacity
**Business impact**: Pre-qualifies leads, reduces incomplete applications by 50%

### Stage 3: "The Application Copilot"
**What it does**: Analyzes applications and provides intelligent recommendations
**Real example**: Assessor asks "Why is this deal declining?" → Agent analyzes DTI, identifies trust income not included, suggests restructure options
**Business impact**: 60% faster assessment decisions, catches issues early

### Stage 4: "The Loan Autopilot"
**What it does**: Autonomously processes applications to unconditional approval with human approval gates
**Real example**:
- Receives application → Orders valuation → Gets human approval → Proceeds
- Identifies missing docs → Generates email to broker → Gets approval → Sends
- Completes verification → Packages for final credit sign-off
**Business impact**: 90% automation, 10-minute conditional approvals, maintains compliance
